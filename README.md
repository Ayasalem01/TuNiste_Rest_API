# TuNiste_Rest_API
# # Academic Project 2022/2023


This API project is created in the framework of the "IT 325: web service" course.
This project is made to demonstrate our skills in developing APIs and working with different technologies. The goal of the project is to provide tourists with information on the top places to visit in each Tunisian city, using a web-based API that can be accessed from any device.

The "Tuniste" Tourist API is a web-based service that provides information on the top places to visit in each Tunisian city. This API is designed to assist tourists in planning their vacations and discovering new and exciting destinations in Tunisia.
